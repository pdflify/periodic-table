    "History": "<p>Scientists had been producing hydrogen for years before it was recognized as an element. Written records indicate that Robert Boyle produced hydrogen gas as early as 1671 while experimenting with <a href=\"ele026.html\">iron<\/a> and acids. Hydrogen was first recognized as a distinct element by Henry Cavendish in 1766.<\/p><p>Composed of a single <a href=\"\/glossary\/proton.html\">proton<\/a> and a single <a href=\"\/glossary\/electron.html\">electron<\/a>, hydrogen is the simplest and <a href=\"\/glossary\/abund_uni.html\">most abundant element in the universe<\/a>. It is estimated that 90% of the visible universe is composed of hydrogen.<\/p><p>Hydrogen is the raw fuel that most stars 'burn' to produce energy. The same process, known as fusion, is being studied as a possible power source for use on earth. The sun's supply of hydrogen is expected to last another 5 billion years.<\/p><p>Hydrogen is a commercially important element. Large amounts of hydrogen are combined with <a href=\"ele007.html\">nitrogen<\/a> from the air to produce ammonia (NH<sub>3<\/sub>) through a process called the Haber process. Hydrogen is also added to fats and oils, such as peanut oil, through a process called hydrogenation. Liquid hydrogen is used in the study of superconductors and, when combined with liquid <a href=\"ele008.html\">oxygen<\/a>, makes an excellent rocket fuel.<\/p><p>Hydrogen combines with other elements to form numerous compounds. Some of the common ones are: water (H<sub>2<\/sub>O), ammonia (NH<sub>3<\/sub>), methane (CH<sub>4<\/sub>), table sugar (C<sub>12<\/sub>H<sub>22<\/sub>O<sub>11<\/sub>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub>) and hydrochloric acid (HCl).<\/p><p>Hydrogen has three common <a href=\"\/glossary\/isotope.html\">isotopes<\/a>. The simplest isotope, called protium, is just ordinary hydrogen. The second, a stable isotope called <a href=\"\/glossary\/deuterium.html\">deuterium<\/a>, was discovered in 1932. The third isotope, <a href=\"\/glossary\/tritium.html\">tritium<\/a>, was discovered in 1934.<\/p>",
    "content": "JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O. JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js. Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.",
